 /*Javascript execution context
   {} --> Global execution context....  refers by this variable
      function execution context
      eval execution context

    {}  memory creation phase
        execution phase 

        Now we gonna discuss how code execute in javascript
        1. Global Execution or environment 
          located by this
        2. Memory Phase
          val1 --> undefined
          val2 --> undefined 
          addnum --> definition 
          result1 --> undefined
          result2 --> undefined
        
        3. Execution Phase 
        val1  <-- 10
        val2  <-- 5
        addNum -->   new variable environment + execution thread

       . Memory Phase 
        val1 --> undefined 
        val2 --> undefined
        total --> undefined
       . execution Context
        num1 --> 10
        num2 --> 5
        total --> 15 
        

         new variable environment + execution thread --> delete


         call stack
